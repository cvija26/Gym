      <Typography fontSize={'22px'} lineHeight='35px' mb={3} ml='10px'>
        This workout for females is designed to tone the whole body, with a slight emphasis on the legs and glutes (bottom). 
        It’s a myth that women will become bulky if they lift weights. Weight training in fact helps women become stronger, leaner and more toned.

      Beginner gym workout for strength
    </Typography>
      <Typography fontSize={'22px'} lineHeight='35px' mb={3} ml='10px'>
      The rep range for strength training is 4 – 6 reps and the idea behind this plan is to exert more energy for less reps (which will mean lifting heavier). 
      If it’s your first time lifting for strength, don’t go too heavy – use a manageable weight for the first few weeks and then increase the load as the weeks go on. 
      Once you think you could lift for 8-10 reps on the same weight, it’s time to increase the weight. Read this guide to help you get started.<br />

      Beginner gym workout for fat loss
      </Typography>
      <Typography fontSize={'22px'} lineHeight='35px' mb={3} ml='10px'>
      This workout is designed to raise your heart rate and get you sweating. The purpose behind this is to push your cardiovascular fitness - when your heart rate is higher you burn more calories. 
      It also has the added benefit of burning extra calories after you've finished the workout, as your body is still working hard to recover back to its normal state of function. 
      So you're essentially burning more while resting just for training your heart a bit harder during your workout.
